# Hi, I'm Isaac 🤙🏼

I'm a full-stack web developer based in São Paulo, Brazil, with over 5 years of experience. I am focused in web and mobile development.

# Some projects

Besides private ones, here are some projects I have been working on:

- [Desgruda](https://github.com/codigoisaac/Desgruda) [in development]: a VSCode formatter extension that separates JSX/TSX elements with a blank line, keeping code more readable.
- [Tabnews clone](https://github.com/codigoisaac/tabnews-clone) [in development]: building [tabnews.com.br](https://tabnews.com.br) from scratch with [curso.dev](https://curso.dev).
- [Binary Shift](https://github.com/codigoisaac/binary-shift): a simple app that converts text to binary code and vice-versa. Made with React and Redux.
- [My old website](https://isaacmuniz.vercel.app): made with Next.js and TailwindCSS, using Notion as headless CMS for the blog.
- [My new (in development) website](https://www.isaacmuniz.pro): minimal personal website with markdown-based blog and my portfolio.
- [SaaS-Base](https://github.com/codigoisaac/SaaS-Base) [in development]: a fullstack Next.js starter designed to eliminate the repetitive setup work that comes with building SaaS products.
- [Abyss](https://github.com/codigoisaac/Abyss): a drawing app I did years ago when I was learning web development.
